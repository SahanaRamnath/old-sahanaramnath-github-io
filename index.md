### Hi, I'm Sahana ðŸ‘‹
I am a Predoctoral Researcher at <a href="https://research.google/teams/india-research-lab/" class="one">Google Research, India</a> in the Advertising Sciences team. I recently graduated from the <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/" class="one">Indian Institute of Technology, Madras</a>, with a BTech in Electrical Engineering and an Interdisciplinary MTech in Data Science.

My research interests lie in applying machine learning and deep learning to solve NLP and multimodal problems. I am also highly interested in analyzing and incorporating *interpretability* in such systems. You can view my work on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YuRzzf0AAAAJ&hl=en" class="two">Google Scholar</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SahanaRamnath" class="two">Github</a>.
